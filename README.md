# Social-engineering-attacks
A Generator words Based Social Engineering Attacks To Getting Some Information About Target Specified Created By CODING CRAB.

This is a web page that allows users to generate social engineering attacks by inputting various information about the target. The web page has a form with five questions asking for the target's name, keywords, birthdays, phone numbers, and old passwords. After the user inputs this information, they can click the "Generate" button to generate a social engineering attack based on the information provided.

The social engineering attack is generated by selecting one of the inputted strings randomly, then adding a random number to the middle of the string. Three random symbols are also added at random positions in the string. The output of the attack is displayed in a div with the ID "output". The web page also keeps a history of all the generated social engineering attacks, which is displayed in a div with the ID "history". Each history item has a "Copy" button that allows the user to copy the generated attack to their clipboard.

The web page also has an "Export" button that allows the user to export the history of generated attacks and the user's answers to the input questions to a text file. The file is downloaded when the user clicks the "Export" button. The text file contains each input question and the user's answer, as well as a list of all the generated social engineering attacks in the history.
